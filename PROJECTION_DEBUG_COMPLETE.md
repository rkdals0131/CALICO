# Projection Debug Node Implementation Complete

## Summary
The projection debug node has been successfully implemented to help debug the sensor fusion matching issues in CALICO.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Projection Debug Node
- **File**: `src/nodes/projection_debug_node.cpp`
- **Header**: `include/calico/nodes/projection_debug_node.hpp`
- Subscribes to LiDAR cones and camera images
- Projects LiDAR points onto image plane using calibration
- Draws green circles at projected positions
- Publishes annotated images for debugging

### 2. Updated Build System
- Modified `CMakeLists.txt` to include the new node
- Added executable and installation targets

### 3. Created Launch Files
- **Standalone**: `launch/projection_debug.launch.py`
- **Integrated**: Updated `launch/calico_full.launch.py` with optional debug

### 4. Documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with usage instructions
- Updated `PRD_CALICO.md` with completion status
- Created `DEBUG_USAGE.md` with detailed usage guide

## How to Use

### Quick Test
```bash
# Build the package
cd /home/user1/ROS2_Workspace/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select calico

# Source the workspace
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# Run debug visualization
ros2 launch calico projection_debug.launch.py

# View output
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
# Select topic: /debug/projection_overlay
```

### With Full System
```bash
ros2 launch calico calico_full.launch.py enable_debug_viz:=true
```

## What to Look For
- Green dots show where LiDAR points project onto the image
- Yellow labels show cone index and color
- White text shows statistics

## Next Steps
1. Run the debug node with live data to see actual projections
2. Compare projected points with YOLO detection boxes
3. Verify if projection falls within detection boundaries
4. Adjust matching distance threshold if needed

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
